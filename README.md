# p8105_hw1_ml5018

This is a README document for homework 1 of p8105, created by Luan Mengxiao.

Here list some basic requirements of this homework.

## Problem 0.1

This “problem” focuses on the use of R Markdown to write reproducible reports, GitHub for version control, and R Projects to organize your work.

To that end:

* create a public GitHub repo + local R Project; we suggest naming this repo / directory p8105_hw1_YOURUNI (e.g. p8105_hw1_ajg2202 for Jeff), but that’s not required
* create a single .Rmd file named p8105_hw1_YOURUNI.Rmd that renders to github_document
* submit a link to your repo via Courseworks

## Problem 0.2

This “problem” focuses on correct styling for your solutions to Problems 1 and 2. We will look for:

* meaningful variable / object names
* readable code (one command per line; adequate whitespace and indentation; etc)
* clearly-written text to explain code and results
* a lack of superfluous code (no unused variables are defined; no extra library calls; etc.)

## Problem 1

This problem focuses the use of inline R code, plotting, and the behavior of ggplot for variables of different types.

## Problem 2

This problem is intended to emphasize variable types and introduce coercion; some awareness of how R treats numeric, character, and factor variables is necessary for working with these data types in practice.
