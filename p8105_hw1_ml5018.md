# Problem 1

## Load the libraray and dataset for further usage:

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
```

## A short description of the dataset:

This dataset contains hourly meterological data for LGA, JFK and EWR for
the month of January 2013. This is a subset of the weather data frame
from nycflights13.

The data frame consists of 358 rows representing hourly measurements and
15 variables:

- origin: Weather station. Named origin to facilitate merging with
  nycflights13::flights data.
- year, month, day, hour: Time of recording.
- temp, dewp:Temperature and dewpoint in F.
- humid: Relative humidity.
- wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust: Wind direction (in degrees), speed
  and gust speed (in mph).
- precip: Precipitation, in inches.
- pressure: Sea level pressure in millibars.
- visib: Visibility in miles.
- time_hour: Date and hour of the recording as a POSIXct date.

## A further examination of the dataset:

Take a brief look at the data set:

``` r
str(early_january_weather)
```

``` r
mean(early_january_weather$temp)
```

The mean temperature in the data is 39.5821229 F.

## Scatter plot of temp vs time_hour

Posted below is a scatter plot of temp (y) vs time_hour (x), using humid
for color points.

``` r
ggplot(data = early_january_weather, 
       mapping = aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_ml5018_files/figure-gfm/plotting-1.png)<!-- -->

Some patterns can easily be observed from the plot: The temperature kept
fluctuating as time passed by, with two enormous drop at the strat and
end of the whole period. In spite of that, the overall trend tended to
go up from 1 January to 15 January. The humidity was fluctuate as well,
with an obvious raise around 14 January.

# Problem 2

## Data frame creation

To create a data frame comprised of:

- a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution;
- a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater
  than 0;
- a character vector of length 10;
- a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”.

``` r
sample <- c("medicine","nursing","biostatistics","medicine","medicine",
            "biostatistics","nursing","biostatistics","nursing","medicine")
Prob2_df = tibble(
  norm_sample = rnorm(10),
  logic_sample = norm_sample > 0,
  char_sample = sample,
  fact_sample = factor(sample)
)
```

Use the code above to generate a data frame as follow:

``` r
Prob2_df
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    norm_sample logic_sample char_sample   fact_sample  
    ##          <dbl> <lgl>        <chr>         <fct>        
    ##  1      0.529  TRUE         medicine      medicine     
    ##  2      0.467  TRUE         nursing       nursing      
    ##  3     -1.77   FALSE        biostatistics biostatistics
    ##  4     -0.611  FALSE        medicine      medicine     
    ##  5     -1.20   FALSE        medicine      medicine     
    ##  6      0.193  TRUE         biostatistics biostatistics
    ##  7      0.0868 TRUE         nursing       nursing      
    ##  8     -1.36   FALSE        biostatistics biostatistics
    ##  9     -1.14   FALSE        nursing       nursing      
    ## 10      1.81   TRUE         medicine      medicine

## Calculate the mean of each variable

Directly utilize `mean` function to calculate the mean of the variables
in the data frame:

``` r
mean(Prob2_df)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(Prob2_df): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

The warning information suggested that the mean value of char_sample and
fact_sample could not be obtained since these two variables are neither
numeric nor logical.

For these two variables, the mean function returns `NA`:

``` r
mean(Prob2_df %>% pull(3))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(Prob2_df %>% pull(3)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(Prob2_df %>% pull(4))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(Prob2_df %>% pull(4)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

To avoid such problem, calculate only the mean of numeric and logical
variables in the data frame, using `pull` function to achieve this goal.

The library `tidyverse`, which contains the `pull` function to be used,
has already been loaded in Problem 1.

The mean value of norm_sample is -0.2991817

The mean value of logic_sample is 0.5

## Conversion variables to numeric

Use `pull` and `as.numeric` to access the variables in the data frame
and convert them into numeric.

``` r
logic_to_num = as.numeric(Prob2_df %>% pull(2))
char_to_num = as.numeric(Prob2_df %>% pull(3))
fact_to_num = as.numeric(Prob2_df %>% pull(4))
```

The result of the code above suggested the logical variable could be
converted to numeric smoothly, with the value `TRUE` and `FALSE`
converted to 1 and 0 respectively. Yet when the character variable was
converted, `NA` was introduced by coersion as a replacement of all the
characters. And for the factor variable, the three levels of factors
were converted to numeric 1, 2 and 3.

It could be inferred from the phenomenon that the character could not be
recognized when converting into numeric, thus explained why the mean
function did not work when using the whole data frame as the object.
